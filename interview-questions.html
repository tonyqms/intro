            <dt>Q3: How did you keep the team aligned?</dt>
            <dd>A3: A shared technical vision plus bi-weekly working sessions and clear updates.</dd>
            <dt>Q4: What was the delivery outcome?</dt>
            <dd>A4: Fully automated, cloud-native, LIMS-supported pipeline delivered in 10 weeks.</dd>
